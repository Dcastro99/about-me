  <h2>Bio</h2>

  <p>
    I've been in warehousing for many years. I've taken these positions to allow myself time to pursue my greatest
    passion, music.
    <br>I've lived in California, Austin, and now Seattle all where I played live shows, toured, and wrote records.
    <br> I love getting involved in many things as i have a strong belief that <i>" if you're not growing, you're
      dying."</i>
    <br> I opened up a restaurant with my brother and cousin 8 years ago in this belief and now currently manage a
    warehouse in Seatle.
    <br> Currently my newest asperation is coding. Excited to see where this new feild will take me tomorrow.
