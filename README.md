## About Me

I build an app with a direct and powerful purpose. It does all of the things that it accomplishes well. I should describe the purpose and functionality so those that visit my README understand the app

### Reflections and Comments

* I find that it's harder for me somwtimes to ask for help but not because I'm scared to ask, but because I feel I can figure out the problem. Funny enough this is exactly what they said not to do.  15 min ask questions. 
* Learning about the way I learn is an intersting concept but an imprtant process.  I realized that reading ahead for me has played a better role in this class.  I'm able to at least be somewhat familiarized with the material. 
* Repetition is what is helping me learn as well. I am ery hands on type of learner.  The reading portions I don't seem to gain much ground in knowldge but serve its purpose.
