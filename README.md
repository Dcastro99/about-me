## About Me

I love the creative process in all my work. On this page I'm able to shed a little light on my life and things I like to do. Creativity is a driving force in my life and I like to leave my work feeling proud of what I've achieved during the process.

### Reflections and Comments

* I find that it's harder for me somwtimes to ask for help but not because I'm scared to ask, but because I feel I can figure out the problem. Funny enough this is exactly what they said not to do.  15 min ask questions. 
* Learning about the way I learn is an intersting concept but an imprtant process.  I realized that reading ahead for me has played a better role in this class.  I'm able to at least be somewhat familiarized with the material. 
* Repetition is what is helping me learn as well. I am ery hands on type of learner.  The reading portions I don't seem to gain much ground in knowldge but serve its purpose.

* today we learned about arrays. This was difficult but fun to play with.  I was able to ask a friend to help me understand a little better.

* Created a variable that counted all the answers correct and tallied them up. this took me a while as well.  I had to reverse engeneer the answer which was fun for me and realized this is a great learning tool for me.

* I also copied my codes and saved them in order to see if I can replicated them  in replit for practice purposes.
